ONLI MCP Service
This repository provides a minimal implementation of the Onli Knowledge Base as a service using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The service is designed to expose the knowledge base about Onli for various applications by responding to API requests with relevant data.

Overview
The core purpose of this service is to demonstrate how to package a domain-specific knowledge base and make it accessible via a standardized protocol. It serves as a foundational component for systems that require factual information about the Onli ecosystem to be retrieved and injected into a larger context.

Key Features
Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation: The service is built to adhere to the MCP specification, ensuring interoperability with other services and models that utilize this protocol.

Minimalist Design: The codebase is intentionally kept small and focused, making it easy to understand, deploy, and extend.

Onli Knowledge Base: It contains a knowledge base with key facts and information about Onli, providing a ready-to-use data source for testing and development.

Request Body Handling: The service is configured to process and respond to requests based on their body content, allowing for flexible querying.

Follow the instructions in the README.md file (to be created) for specific setup, dependency installation, and running the service.
