# Definitions

This document defines the core entities in the Onli ecosystem.

## ONLI™
A technology that ensures the unique quantification of stored and transferred data.

## OnliOne
A private computing network of hyper‑dimensional vector storage systems. It contains Vaults and Owners and enables uniqueness quantification across connected devices.

## Vaults
Self‑contained execution environments that store Genomes (assets) and Genes (owner identities). Each Vault is under the direct control of its owner and acts as the secure storage for assets, ensuring actual possession【887808116772823†L21-L31】.

## Assets (Branded Genomes)
Branded Genomes that live in Vaults. A generic asset is called an Onli.

## Genomes
Hyperdimensional vector storage objects composed of 10 Helices. They serve as unique digital objects – “Genomes” evolve as they move from one owner to another【887808116772823†L21-L31】.

## Helices
Hyperdimensional vectors that make up a Genome. Each Genome contains 10 Helices.

## Base Pairs
Fundamental data representations inside a Helix. Each Base Pair stores an attribute–value pair.

## Genes
Special Genomes that represent an owner’s digital identity. They contain agents for security, identity, authentication and authorization and are tied to a Vault and Owner【887808116772823†L21-L31】.

## Agents
Autonomous programs that compute base pairs. Agents operate within Vaults and OnliOne to enforce policies and implement behaviours.

## Owners
Human users of OnliOne. Each owner possesses a Gene and can own assets (Genomes). Owners authenticate and authorize actions via their Gene.

## Issuers
Special users that mint and issue assets to owners. Issuers own Treasuries.

## Treasuries
Special vaults that store newly minted, unissued assets.

## Mint
A special vault containing the algorithms for generating unowned assets (Genomes).

## Appliances
Applications running on the Onli Cloud OS. Appliances interact with owners and implement business logic (e.g., marketplaces, digital wallets). Developers build Appliances to connect clients (Onli You) to the Onli Cloud.

## ONLI Cloud
A cloud operating system that manages the operation and execution of the OnliOne network. It provides functions‑as‑a‑service (FaaS) for issuance, transfers, settlement and Oracle registration but never stores the asset itself【887808116772823†L88-L100】.
