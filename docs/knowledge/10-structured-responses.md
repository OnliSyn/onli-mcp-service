KB = {
    "what_is_onli": (
        "Onli creates unique digital objects called Genomes, stored in your Vault and "
        "bound to your Gene. Possession equals ownership: if it’s in your Vault, you own it."
    ),
    "what_can_you_do": (
        "Use Onli to issue credentials, legal documents, titles, financial instruments, "
        "KYC proofs and more. Genomes, Genes and Vaults enable secure issuance, transfer "
        "and verification without a public ledger."
    ),
    "eli10": (
        "Onli is like a magic treasure chest (Vault) holding special objects (Genomes). "
        "Only you can open your chest. When you give an object to someone, it leaves your chest "
        "and moves into theirs. No copies, no tricks!"
    ),
    "how_does_it_work": (
        "Issuers mint Genomes into a Vault. Transfers destroy the old copy and recreate it in the "
        "recipient’s Vault. Vaults are private; the network records receipts of transfers but not "
        "the contents."
    ),
    "how_is_different": (
        "Blockchains transfer information on a public ledger; Onli transfers the actual object in "
        "private Vaults, with no miners or tokens required. It’s a possession-based system."
    ),
    "why_important": (
        "Onli gives real digital ownership: assets that you control completely. It’s ideal for "
        "credentials, financial instruments, titles and sensitive data."
    ),
    "is_blockchain": (
        "No. Onli is not a blockchain. It has no public ledger, no mining, no gas fees, and does "
        "not use cryptocurrency."
    ),
    "possession_vs_custody": (
        "Actual possession means the Genome is in your Vault—only you can move or destroy it. "
        "Custodial possession means a third party holds it on your behalf. Onli supports both, "
        "but its default model is actual possession."
    ),
    "onli_one": (
        "Onli One is the peer-to-peer network layer that moves Genomes between Vaults, enforces "
        "policies and records transfer receipts."
    ),
    "use_owner": (
        "Owners create a Gene, set up their Vault, receive Genomes from issuers and use Appliances "
        "to move or prove them. They control all transfers."
    ),
    "use_developer": (
        "Developers build Appliances that call flows such as Issue, Ask2Move, Move and ChangeOwner; "
        "retrieve receipts; and enforce policy logic via their backend."
    ),
    "use_issuer": (
        "Issuers define denominations/series, mint Genomes into recipients’ Vaults, attach policies "
        "(e.g. settlement lockers), and publish verification rules."
    ),
}
