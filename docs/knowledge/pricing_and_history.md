# Pricing and History

## History & Founders
Onli was founded in 2010 by Dhryl Anton, Michael McFall, Peter Jenson Haxel, and Michaela Katherine Anton. These founders created Onli to solve the problem of uniqueness and ownership of digital objects. The company has since developed Onli One, Onli Cloud, and a suite of developer tools for issuing and managing digital assets with cryptographic security and actual possession.

## Pricing and Costs
Onliâ€™s pricing model is straightforward. For developers building Appliances:

- **Developer subscription**: $500 per month, or $6,000 per year for a team of three. This subscription grants access to Onli Cloud APIs, Vault infrastructure, and developer support.

- **Treasury issuance fee**: $50,000 per billion units (sold only in billion-unit increments), plus $0.05 per asset issued. This fee covers the cost of minting a batch of unissued Genomes in a Treasury vault. There are no ongoing transaction, gas or mining fees beyond the initial issuance.

- **No hidden fees**: Onli Cloud does not charge percentages of asset value or transaction fees. Costs are based on infrastructure and issuance only.

## Deployment Considerations
For a typical enterprise deployment, plan for the developer subscription and treasury issuance costs. Additional expenses may include infrastructure for Vaults (e.g. secure enclaves) and professional services for integrating Onli with your existing systems. Onli provides consultation and support packages to assist with architecture, compliance and custom Appliance development.
