# Genomes

A **Genome** is a unique, self-contained digital object bound to a user's **Gene** (cryptographic identity). Each Genome is provably unique and cannot be copied or duplicated.

- **Unitary:** A Genome cannot be subdivided. Balances arise from holding multiple Genomes minted within a denomination/series. "Split delivery" means distributing multiple Genomes rather than splitting one.
- **Ownership:** Possession equals ownership. If a Genome resides in your Vault, you are its owner, and only you can move or destroy it.
- **Lifecycle:** Genomes are minted by Issuers, transferred (destroyed and re-created) via the `Ask2Move â†’ Move` flow, and eventually destroyed when no longer needed.

Genomes are stored privately in your Vault; only transfer receipts (metadata) are recorded by the Onli One network.
