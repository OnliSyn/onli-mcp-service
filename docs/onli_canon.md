# Onli Canon

## What is Onli

Onli is a technology that ensures the unique quantification of data—making it possible for there to be only one container across a network of devices. This is achieved by storing data as containers within three-dimensional tensor arrays, inside a hyper-dimensional vector space, where every container is bound to a unique credential called a Gene.

This architecture guarantees singularity, authenticity, and ownership: no duplicates, no copies, no versions—only one.

## What is Onli For

Making **Assets**.

An **Asset** is the practical outcome of this principle: a container that exists as a true one-of-one digital thing. Because it is singular and unforgeable, an Asset is not just information—it turns information into value.

Assets can function as:

- **Micro‑commodities**: divisible resources traded in granular units.
- **Micro‑currencies**: secure instruments of exchange.
- **Vector embeddings**: machine‑readable forms powering AI‑native search and agentic intelligence.
- **Controlled Assets**: unique data you govern and embed, such as intellectual property, proprietary models, or creative works.

This versatility makes Onli a foundation not only for digital value exchange but also for identity management, agentic applications, and AI‑native intelligence.

## Elevator Pitch

Onli is a hyper‑dimensional storage system where every container is bound to a unique credential called a Gene, ensuring there can only be one across the network. These one‑of‑one containers are called **Assets**—true digital things that can serve as commodities, currencies, embeddings, or protected data.

## The Onli Ecosystem

The **Onli Ecosystem** is the integrated environment for true digital ownership. It connects **Issuers**, **Owners**, **Vaults**, **Genes**, **OnliCloud**, **Appliances**, and the peer‑to‑peer **Onli One Network** into a seamless whole. Together, these components ensure that data is uniquely quantifiable, securely owned, and natively usable across digital value exchange, identity management, and AI.

### 1. Issuers

Issuers are the creators and branders of Assets. They define the identity, metadata, and function of each Asset before it enters circulation. By binding containers to Gene credentials, Issuers guarantee authenticity at the moment of creation.

Issuers give Assets their brand signature, which becomes inseparable from the Asset itself—whether it is a micro‑currency, a commodity, an embedding, or protected data.

### 2. Owners

Owners are the exclusive holders of Assets. Ownership is enforced through Gene credentials, which give them sole authority to store, manage, and transfer their containers.

Owners interact with their Assets through **OnliYou**, their universal interface.

### 3. OnliYou

OnliYou is the secure gateway for Owners. It provides:

- Vault access for Asset management.
- OnliID as a unified digital identity credential.
- Oracle services for tamper‑proof verification.
- Profile management—one profile to rule them all.

### 4. Vaults

Vaults are self‑contained execution environments where Assets live.

- They store **Genomes** (containers bound to Genes).
- Enforce possession: only the Owner controls what’s inside.
- Operate inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with hardware isolation for tamper‑resistance.

### 5. Onli One Network

The **Onli One Network** is the peer‑to‑peer fabric that enforces unique quantification of data across devices. It guarantees that every Asset is one‑of‑one: no duplicates, no copies, no versions.

Transfers occur only when an Owner authorizes them, ensuring Assets move with integrity.

### 6. OnliCloud

**OnliCloud** is the management layer for the ecosystem. It is where:

- Issuers create and register new Assets.
- Developers build **Appliances** using Onli APIs.
- Owners oversee Asset functions and integrate with applications.

OnliCloud ensures that developers innovate, Appliances orchestrate, and Owners remain fully in control.

### 7. Appliances

Appliances are applications built on OnliCloud APIs. They:

- Connect Owners and Issuers to services.
- Orchestrate interactions and enforce business rules.
- Request transactions but cannot move Assets without Owner approval.

They are the interface layer that brings Onli into real‑world use cases.

### Flow Summary

- **Issuers** create and brand Assets.
- **Owners** hold and control them.
- **OnliYou** is the Owner’s secure gateway.
- **Vaults** provide isolated, tamper‑proof storage.
- The **Onli One Network** enforces singularity and peer‑to‑peer transfer.
- **OnliCloud** manages creation, orchestration, and integration.
- **Appliances** deliver practical applications to end‑users.
