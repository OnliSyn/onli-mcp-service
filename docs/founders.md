# Founders of Onli

## A Founder's Story

### The Genesis (2010)

In 2010, four visionaries—Dhryl Anton, Peter Jensen Haxel, Michael McFall, and M. Katherine Anton—came together with an ambitious goal: to build a trading market for securitizing revenue from transactions that don't involve credit. What seemed like a financial technology challenge quickly revealed a much deeper problem at the heart of computing itself.

As the founders dove deeper into their original concept, they discovered a fundamental obstacle: creating true digital assets required solving what they termed the "uniqueness quantification" problem—a major computing challenge that had never been adequately addressed. This realization became the catalyst for something far more revolutionary than they initially imagined.

### The Pivot: From Trading Platform to Computing Revolution

Rather than abandon their vision, the team pivoted to solve the underlying problem. They began developing what would become **cloudMo.de**, later evolving into **Vescel** and ultimately the **Onli platform** we know today. Their mission expanded from creating a trading marketplace to reimagining the very foundation of how data is stored, shared, and controlled.

### The Innovation: A New Computing Paradigm

The founders recognized that existing internet infrastructure was fundamentally flawed. Traditional browsers and web technologies couldn't provide the security, control, and true ownership that digital assets demanded. So they invented something entirely new.

**Key breakthroughs include:**

- **Immutable transaction system** — a revolutionary method for creating immutable transactions in data storage.
- **Semantic ternary model** — moving beyond hierarchical file systems to a more sophisticated semantic approach.
- **Unified transaction syntax** — creating a consistent language for all data operations.
- **Authentication & authorization as transactions** — treating security as fundamental data operations rather than add‑ons.
- **Unforgeable credentials** — advancing computer science by creating truly secure identity verification.
- **Structural data control** — moving beyond simple access control to govern actual data usage.

The result? A technology that can be summarized in one powerful word: **Privatize**—moving data from public control to true private control.

### The Evolution: From Vision to Reality

- **2011 – first release**: Onli version 0.1 launched by CloudMoDe LLC in Las Vegas, Nevada, accompanied by their foundational white paper.
- **2012 – first application**: The team proved their concept with **Opportuneti™**, a music‑publishing application for iOS—the first real‑world demonstration of their technology in action.
- **2014 – major milestone**: Onli version 1.0 was released by the newly formed **Onli Inc.**, marking their transition from research to commercial viability.
- **2016 – enterprise focus**: Version 2.0 launched from Paradise Valley, Nevada, with notable enterprise implementations:
  - **Nicce (Nevada)**—pioneering cryptocurrency applications in the cannabis industry.
  - **Alta (Arizona)**—supporting cannabis‑market expansion with secure data solutions.

The founders’ groundbreaking work has been recognized through multiple patents, documenting their contributions to computer science and data security.

### The Future: Version 3.0 and Beyond

August 2023 marked another significant milestone with the release of **version 3.0**, continuing the founders' mission to transform how the world thinks about data ownership, digital assets, and online privacy.

### The Vision Realized

What began as an attempt to create a trading platform for non‑credit revenue streams became something far more significant: a complete reimagining of internet infrastructure. The founders of Onli didn't just solve their original problem— they created the foundation for a new kind of internet where users truly own and control their data.

Today, Onli represents more than a technology platform; it embodies a fundamental shift toward digital sovereignty, proving that sometimes the most revolutionary solutions come from refusing to accept the limitations of existing systems.
