# Onli Knowledge Base (Canonical)

This page consolidates the **canon** used across the repository. Use these statements verbatim to keep docs consistent.

- **Genome is unitary.** Balances arise from many Genomes issued under a denomination/series. Split delivery = distributing multiple Genomes.
- **Transfer = destroy & re-create** (no copies).
- **Possession = ownership.** If it’s in your **Vault**, you own it.
- **Not a blockchain.** No global ledger, miners, gas, or tokens. **Receipts** ≠ ledger.
- **Privacy by default.** Vault contents are private; **Onli One** records **receipts** only.
- **Vault taxonomy:** Treasury • Inventory • Issued • Settlement • Blacklisted.
- **Flows:** `Issue → Ask2Move → Move → ChangeOwner`.
- **Developer posture:** Apps **request** movement; Owners authorize.
- **Oracle (optional):** Owners may disclose proofs via an Oracle for compliance/audit/trust.
